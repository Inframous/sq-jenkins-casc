# Jenskins-Casc (sq-proj-1)
## (Configurations as Code)
This is a part of an assignment I recieved to create an infrastructure for a basic python site, and pipelines to test and deploy it.
This repo is used to setup a Jenkins installation using the configuration-as-code-plugin.
The file 'casc.yaml' has all of the relevant configurations and the jobs.
'plugins.txt' has the list of plugins to be installed.
